Reviewer 3 of IROS 2015 submission 1823

Comments to the author
======================

In this paper, development of a soft manipulator with a
grasping actuator is described. This manipulator is made by
rubber material and very flexible. I considered that the
robots such as communication robots need intrinsic safety.
To achieve the safety, flexibility of manipulator is one of
important factors. The main works of this study is
implementation of original control method. The grasp and
place in any position at a planer is succeeded. 

1.	It should be clear the advantages for the structure
of manipulator and grasping actuator. I know some similar
researches of the structure and manufacturing method. I
didn’t know the difference between proposed manipulator and
conventional it. 
2.	In section 3-C, “a bend angle” is described. How is
defined this angle? In the case of development of soft
manipulator and others, this parameter is many defined
respectively. I want to explain using figure. 
3.	The movie is interesting. However, I have some
questions. 
A)	What is the reason of generating for pulsation in
air chamber? 
B)	The convergence time from start point to goal point
is long. In this works, the original point is the control
algorithm. But I didn’t know the advantage of this control
method. I think the PI control by using visual sensor is
better. 
4.	What is the application? The paper indicates the
task of grasping and place working as like industrial
robots. However, it seems that the force and velocity is
insufficient according to the movie. As application for
communication robot, this demonstration is inaptitude.
